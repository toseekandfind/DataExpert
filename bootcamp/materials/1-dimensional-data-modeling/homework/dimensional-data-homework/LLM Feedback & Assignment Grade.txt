## Feedback on Submission

### 1. Correctness

- **Actors Table DDL (1_actors_ddl.sql):**
  - The table creation script looks good. It correctly includes the necessary fields with appropriate data types. The `actorid` is set as the primary key, which makes sense for uniquely identifying each actor.
  - The use of an array of structs for films captures the data naturally, allowing you to store multiple films per actor.

- **Cumulative Query (2_cumulative_query.sql):**
  - The cumulative query is correctly crafting a list of films for each actor up to the current year. The `recent_avg_rating` calculation ensures the quality class and active status are up-to-date.
  - The use of a `merge` statement for upsert operations is efficient and fits the use case well.
  - This script appears to function as intended, maintaining updated actor information by year.

- **Actors History SCD DDL (3_actors_history_scd_ddl.sql):**
  - The Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) table is defined correctly. It has an appropriate structure for storing historical versions with `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_current`.
  - The primary key chosen (`actorid`, `start_date`) uniquely identifies each version per actor.

- **Backfill Query (4_actors_history_scd_backfill.sql):**
  - The query is well-constructed to backfill historical data, identifying changes in actor status year over year.
  - Usage of window functions like `lag()` is apt for detecting changes in `quality_class` or `is_active` status.
  - The logic for defining version boundaries and inserting them is sound, ensuring accurate historical records are captured.

- **Incremental Update Query (5_actors_history_scd_incremental.sql):**
  - This script correctly identifies and processes actors with changed or new status using the `merge` pattern.
  - It effectively differentiates between `NEW`, `CHANGED`, and `UNCHANGED` status using `left join` logic.
  - The script intelligently updates historical records and inserts new records for actors with changed statuses.

### 2. Efficiency and Best Practices

- The use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) makes the scripts easy to read and understand.
- The use of `merge` statements and window functions demonstrates good application of SQL operations for complex data manipulation tasks.

### 3. Improvements

- A potential improvement could be adding indexes or constraints where necessary to ensure data integrity and improve query performance, especially on frequently queried fields like `quality_class`.

- Validation of input data (e.g., ensuring `actorid` and `year` are correctly formatted) is crucial for production environments, though not strictly necessary for the logic demonstrated here.

### 4. Documentation and Comments

- The scripts are well-commented, making them easy to follow and understand by anyone reviewing or maintaining them in the future.

### Overall Assessment

Your submission demonstrates a strong understanding of SQL concepts, particularly how to maintain and update tables with historical versions using SCD methods. The scripts are correctly structured, efficient, and neatly documented.
